# File-Permission-Change

Magento installation out of the box does not use the correct and safe file permissions for our servers. 

1. Download this file and upload it to your "public_html" directory (or any directory your Magento installation is located in).

2. Run the file in your web browser by going to: yourdomain.com/filepermission.php

3. The page will run continously and once done, you will see the message "File Permissions All Set for Magento!".

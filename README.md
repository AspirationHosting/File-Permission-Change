# File-Permission-Change

Many applications, including Magento 1.x and 2.0 does not use the correct and safe file permissions for our servers out of the box. 

Please follow the steps below to correct the file permissions in your hosting account. 

The steps below can be easily done with the <strong>cPanel File Manager</strong>.


1. Download <a href="https://github.com/AspirationHosting/File-Permission-Change/archive/master.zip">this .zip file</a> and upload it to your <strong>public_html</strong> directory (<strong><em>or</em></strong> any directory your application installation is located in).

2. Extract the .zip and you will see the <strong>filepermission.php</strong> file.

3. Run the file in your web browser by going to: <strong>yourdomain.com/filepermission.php</strong>

4. The page will load continously and once done, you will see the message "<strong>File Permissions All Set!</strong>".
